### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Free hands here, I'll do your embedded tasks, machine learning tasks, android tasks, IOT tasks and edge computing tasks if you agree to share with me a some of your experience. Trading my time for your experience in this sector.

I endeavour to build full stack solutions from working hardware solutions to hosted apis and web apps for a full solution.

things that always get my attention include QED, biosensors and internet of things applications, even at a nanoscale level.
