### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am an Instrumentation and control professional with a keen interest in solving embedded systems problems using a computational physics approach, and with the touch of artificial intelligence.

I endeavour to build full stack solutions from working hardware solutions to hosted apis and web apps for a full solution.

things that always get my attention include QED, biosensors and internet of things applications, even at a nanoscale level.
